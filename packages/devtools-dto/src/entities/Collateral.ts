/**
 * Represents an axon collateral in the CNStra neural network.
 *
 * Collaterals are output channels that neurons use to send signals.
 * The neuronId field indicates which neuron OWNS this collateral (i.e., which neuron
 * can send signals on this collateral).
 *
 * To build neural network connections:
 * - Use Collateral.neuronId to find which neuron owns each collateral (signal source)
 * - Use Dendrite.collateralName to find which neurons listen to each collateral (signal destination)
 * - Connect: Collateral owner â†’ Dendrite listener
 *
 * @see Neuron - the entity that owns this collateral
 * @see Dendrite - entities that listen to this collateral
