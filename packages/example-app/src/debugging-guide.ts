👨‍💻 REAL DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE: "My neurons show 0 signals!"

📊 ISSUE ANALYSIS:
From the logs above, you can see the ROOT CAUSE:

🔍 NEURONS are defined with FULL IDs:
   ✅ "id": "ecommerce-app:auth-service"
   ✅ "id": "ecommerce-app:search-service"
   ✅ "id": "ecommerce-app:cart-service"

⚠️  STIMULATIONS are sent with SHORT IDs:
   ❌ "neuronId": "auth-service"      (missing "ecommerce-app:" prefix)
   ❌ "neuronId": "search-service"    (missing "ecommerce-app:" prefix)
   ❌ "neuronId": "cart-service"      (missing "ecommerce-app:" prefix)

💥 RESULT: No linking between neurons and stimulations = 0 SIGNALS!

📋 HOW TO DEBUG THIS IN DEVTOOLS:

Step 1: Open DevTools at http://localhost:5173
Step 2: You'll see neurons in the graph but they show 0 signals
Step 3: Navigate to "⚡ Stimulations" page
Step 4: You'll see activity, but neuronIds don't match neuron definitions
Step 5: Compare the IDs to identify the mismatch

🔧 THE FIX:
Either change neuron definitions to use short IDs, or fix stimulations to use full IDs.

This is a REAL production issue that developers encounter!
`);

// Function to demonstrate the issue
function demonstrateNeuronIdMismatch() {
    const neuronsWithFullIds = [
        'ecommerce-app:auth-service',
        'ecommerce-app:search-service',
        'ecommerce-app:cart-service'
    ];

    const stimulationsWithShortIds = [
        'auth-service',
        'search-service',
        'cart-service'
    ];

    console.log('\n🔍 NEURON ID MISMATCH ANALYSIS:');

    neuronsWithFullIds.forEach((neuronId, index) => {
        const stimulationId = stimulationsWithShortIds[index];
        const match = neuronId.includes(stimulationId);

        console.log(`
Neuron:      "${neuronId}"
Stimulation: "${stimulationId}"
Match: ${match ? '✅ PARTIAL' : '❌ NO'} ${match ? '(but not exact)' : ''}
Issue: ${neuronId !== stimulationId ? '❌ IDs do not match exactly' : '✅ Perfect match'}
        `);
    });

    console.log(`
💡 SOLUTION OPTIONS:

Option 1 - Fix Stimulations (Recommended):
   Change stimulations to use full IDs:
   "neuronId": "ecommerce-app:auth-service"

Option 2 - Fix Neuron Definitions:
   Change neurons to use short IDs:
   "id": "auth-service"

Option 3 - Add ID Mapping Logic:
   Create translation layer between short and full IDs

🎯 This demonstrates why testing with REAL data is crucial!

// Add collateral naming issue demonstration
function demonstrateCollateralMismatch() {
    console.log(`
🚨 ADDITIONAL ISSUE: Collateral Name Mismatches

From the logs, you can also see:

🔍 NEURON AXON COLLATERALS (camelCase):
   ✅ "userAuthenticated", "recordMetric", "auditLog"

⚠️  ACTUAL COLLATERALS (kebab-case):
   ❌ "user-authenticated", "record-metric", "audit-log"

💥 RESULT: Even if neuronIds were fixed, collateral names don't match!

📋 DEBUGGING STEPS:
1. Check Signal Debugger in DevTools
2. Look for mismatched collateral names
3. Compare neuron definitions vs actual usage

🔧 THE FIX: Standardize naming convention across the system
