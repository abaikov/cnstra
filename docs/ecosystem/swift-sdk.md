A Swift implementation of CNStra is available as a separate package. See the repository for details, examples, and API docs.

- Repository: [abaikov/cnstra-swift](https://github.com/abaikov/cnstra-swift)

Highlights:
- Graph-routed, type-safe orchestration for iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and server-side Swift
- Deterministic traversal from collateral → dendrite → returned signal
- Concurrency gates and async scheduling options

Use it to share architectural patterns across web and Apple platforms.
